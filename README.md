I've created a complete text-based RPG game with the following features:    

Rich terminal interface with colored text and panels
Character creation and status display
Combat system with multiple enemies
Inventory system
Shop system
Level up mechanics
Experience and gold rewards

To run the game, you'll need to install the required packages:    
bashCopypip install rich click
Then you can run the game:
bashCopypython game.py
The game includes:

Different types of enemies (Goblin, Wolf, Bandit, Dragon)
Combat actions (attack, use potion, run)
A shop to buy items
Health potions system
Level-up mechanism
Character statistics tracking
